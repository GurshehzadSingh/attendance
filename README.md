# Why make this
This a small tool made for teachers who are taking attendance with screenshots.
I made this for my mother because after every class I saw her writing down roll numbers on a piece of paper and crossing them out after referring to screenshots of the participants that she took. Although I could not automate the process of taking attendance completely because zoom has a paid API, I thought of atlest doing something that could limit her hardwork in some way.

This also creates a message to send to other teachers about the attendence
